# Overview
The samples provided with the geotracking API are organized as follows:
- **recording:** The Recording sample demonstrates how to record data from both a ZED camera and an external GNSS sensor. The recorded data is saved in an SVO file and a JSON file, respectively. This sample provides the necessary data for the Playback sample. 
- **playback:** The Playback sample shows how to use the geotracking API for global scale localization on a real-world map. It takes the data generated by the Recording sample and uses it to display geo-positions on a real-world map.
- **geotracking:** The GeoTracking sample demonstrates how to use the geotracking API for global scale localization on a real-world map using both the ZED camera and an external GNSS sensor. It displays the corrected positional tracking in the ZED reference frame on an OpenGL window and the geo-position on a real-world map in ZEDHub.
