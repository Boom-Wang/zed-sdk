# Overview
This repository contains multiple samples, including:
 - **floor plane:**: This sample shows two ways to automatically detect the floor plane and set it as origin of a virtual view.
 - **plane detection:** This sample shows how to perform plane detection with ZED Camera. You can use either the plane at hit functionality or the automatic floor plane detection.
